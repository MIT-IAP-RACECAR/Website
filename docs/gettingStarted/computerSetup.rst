Setting up your Local Computer
============================================

This page will walk you through the steps needed to prepare your personal computer to program your RACECAR-MN.  Your computer can use Windows, Mac, or Linux.

Prerequisites Programs
""""""""""""""""""""""

`Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/Download>`_: This is the text editor that we will use to write Python files for our RACECAR-MN.  We recommend using Visual Studio Code because it is free and open source and has great collaboration features (`Visual Studio Live Share <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare>`_), debugging tools, and integration with Git.

`Ubuntu on Windows (Windows Only) <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab>`_: If you are using Windows, please install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store.  This will allow us to use ``bash``, the Linux shell, which is necessary for communicating with our RACECAR-MN.

Setup

The RACECAR-MN libraries and labs are distributed through `GitHub Classroom <https://classroom.github.com/g/nmCrqUal>`_.  Use this link to either create a new team or join an existing team.

`This webpage <https://matthewcalligaro.github.io/RacecarWebsite/scripts/tool_setup.html>`_ will walk you through the remaining steps needed to set up your personal computer.
