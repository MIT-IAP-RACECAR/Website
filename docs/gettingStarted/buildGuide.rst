Tightness
"""""""""

If we leave a screw or MF standoff too lose, it can wiggle loose and fall off.  If we over-tighten a screw or MF standoff, we can damage the part, strip the screw, or strip the threads.  Especially when we are tapping into plastic, it is very easy to strip off the threads created in the plastic, which prevents the rod from staying in the hole.

Throughout this assembly guide, we specify six levels of screw tightness:

1. *Partial*: Do not tighten the screw all of the way and intentionally leave extra room so the part is free to move.
2. *Very gentle*: Slowly tightening the screw or MF standoff and stop as soon it touches the part.
3. *Gentle*: Slowly tighten the screw until it touches the part, then apply a small amount of pressure to tighten it further.
4. *Moderate*: Slowly tighten the screw until it touches the part, then apply a moderate amount of pressure to tighten it further.
5. *Tight*: Tighten the screw with a large amount of pressure.
6. *Very tight*: Tighten the screw as much as you can without hurting yourself.

To help avoid stripping a screw, always use the largest screwdriver which fully fits in the head of the screw.

Safety Precautions
""""""""""""""""""

In order to protect the parts of RACECAR-MN during assembly, please take the following two precautions:

* **Protective film**: The **camera** and the **monitor** come with a layer of protective film covering the lense and screen respectively.  Please leave the protective film on these devices until the car is fully assembled to help protect against any scratches that can occur during assembly.
* **Static shock**: Have you ever touched a door knob and felt a small shock?  All of printed circuits (namely the **Jetson Nano**, the **Arduino**, the **PWM**, and the **LIDAR PCB**) can be damaged if they receive one of these electric shocks.  Thus, before handling any of these pieces, please touch a large piece of metal (such as a metal door handle) to discharge any static electricity in your body.
