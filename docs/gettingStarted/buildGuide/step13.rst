Step 13: Speaker
============================================

New parts used in this step (see the :ref:`parts_list` for details):

* **speaker**
* **foam tape**

13.1 Apply Foam Tape
""""""""""""""""""""

Cut one piece of **foam tape** approximately 2.5 inches long and attach it to the middle of the **speaker** by firmly pressing the **foam tape**.  Be sure to place the tape on the bottom of the **speaker** (the side with the two light gray pieces of rubber).  Finally, remove the wax paper from the **foam tape** to expose the other sticky side.

13.2 Attach Speaker
"""""""""""""""""""

On the blue side of the **top plate**, attach the speaker to the very back of the car, directly above the **USB hub** attached in step 12.3.  The speaker should point toward the back of the car, with the speaker cable pointing toward the front of the car.  Firmly press the **speaker** while supporting the other side of the **top plate** to secure the **foam tape**.
