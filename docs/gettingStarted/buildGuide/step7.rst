Step 7: USB Hub
============================================

New parts used in this step (see the :ref:`parts_list` for details):

* One **USB hub**
* **foam tape**

7.1 Apply Foam Tape
""""""""""""""""""""

Cut one piece of **foam tape** approximately 3.5 inches long and attach the sticky side to the middle of a **USB hub** by firmly pressing the **foam tape**.  Be sure to place the tape on the bottom of the **USB hub**, which is the side that does not say "Anker".  Finally, remove the wax paper from the **foam tape** to expose the other sticky side.

""""""""""""""""""""""""""

On the underside of the **base plate**, attach the **USB hub** toward the back of the car with the USB ports pointing toward the battery cradle.  Make sure that the front edge of the **USB hub** is roughly in line with the middle of the square holes as shown in the pictures below.  Firmly press the **USB hub** to secure the **foam tape**.
