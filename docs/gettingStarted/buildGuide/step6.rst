Step 6: LIDAR
============================================

Screw tightness: *gentle*

New parts used in this step (see the :ref:`parts_list` for details):

* **LIDAR**
* Four **M2.5x0.45 12mm screws (H)**

Align the four legs of the **LIDAR** with the holes shown on the top side of the **base plate**, which are toward the front of the car behind the camera installed in Step 2.  Screw a **M2.5x0.45 12mm screw** into each leg (4 total) such that the head of each screw touches the underside of the **base plate** (see screws circled in red in image below, right).  Be sure to tighten the screws in multiple stages using a crisscross pattern.

Finally, connect the colorful LIDAR cable from the **LIDAR PCB** to the **LIDAR** as shown in the picture below.  The cable should feed through one of the large holes of the **base plate**.
