Step 6: Main Standoffs
============================================

Screw tightness: *very tight*

New parts used in this step (see the :ref:`parts_list` for details):

* Six **8-32 FF standoffs**
* Six **8-32 9/16 screws (B)**
* Six **washers**

First, place a **washer** over each of the six **8-32 9/16 screws (B)** as shown in the picture below.

Next, identify the six holes around the edge of the **bottom plate** shown in the pictures below.  For each hole, place an **8-32 9/16 screw (B)** with a **washer** through the hole such that the washer and screw head touch the uncolored side of the **bottom plate**.  On the red side of the **bottom plate**, secure the screw with an **8-32 FF standoff**, which you tightening by hand for now.

Next, tighten the six screws using a crisscross pattern with multiple stages.  To tighten a screw, hold the base of the standoff with a *wrench* such that the *wrench* also touches the **bottom plate** as shown in the picture below.  Then, use a *large Philips screwdriver* to tighten the screw from the other side.  On the final stage of your crisscross pattern, tighten the screws as tightly as possible without injuring yourself or stripping the screw.
