Step 10: Top Plate
============================================

New parts used in this step (see the :ref:`parts_list` for details):

* Six **8-32 9/16 screws (B)**
* Six **washers**

10.1 Remove Monitor
"""""""""""""""""""

Remove the **monitor** by unscrewing the **M6x1 8mm screw (G)** used in step 7.3.  This is necessary because the **monitor** blocks two of the screw holes needed in step 10.2.

10.2 Attach Top Plate
"""""""""""""""""""""

Screw tightness: *very tight*

On the **top plate**, you will find the same pattern of six holes used in step 6.  Align these holes with the **8-32 FF standoffs** attached to the **bottom plate**.  Secure each hole with a **washer** and an **8-32 9/16 screw (B)** such that the washer and screw head are on the blue side of the **top plate**.  Tighten the screws in multiple stages using a crisscross pattern with a *large philips screwdriver*.  Since the standoff is already held in place on the **bottom plate**, you do not need to use a *wrench*.
