Step 5: LIDAR PCB
============================================

New parts used in this step (see the :ref:`parts_list` for details):

* **LIDAR PCB**
* Four **4-40 standoffs**
* Four **4-40 1/4 screws (E)**

5.1 Attach Standoffs
""""""""""""""""""""

Screw tightness: *very gentle*

Gently screw four **4-40 MF standoffs** into the four holes shown on the underside of the **base plate** using a *3/16 hex screwdriver* (note 2 installed, highlighted in blue, and 2 missing, highlighted in red, in the image).  These holes are toward the front of the plate and in front of the PWM attached in Step 4.

""""""""""""""""""""

| **Warning**: *discharge any static before touching the LIDAR PCB*\
| Screw tightness: *gentle*

Carefully align the four screw holes of the **LIDAR PCB** with the **4-40 MF standoffs** attached in step 5.1.  Make sure that the two micro USB ports of the **LIDAR PCB** point upward as shown in the picture below.  Secure the the **LIDAR PCB** to the standoffs using four **4-40 1/4 screws (E)**.  Tighten the screws with a *small Philips screwdriver* using a crisscross pattern with multiple stages.
