Step 3: Battery Cradle
============================================

New parts used in this step (see the :ref:`parts_list` for details):

* **battery plate**
* **battery ring**
* Six **4-40 FF standoffs**
* Six **4-40 5/8 screws (C)**
* Six **4-40 7/16 screws (D)**

As a reminder, an FF standoff looks like this.

3.1 Create Battery Cradle
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Screw tightness: *tight*

Place the **battery ring** on top of the **battery plate** such that the six holes align and both pieces face upwards.  One at a time, place a **4-40 5/8 screw (C)** through one hole and secure the other side with a **4-40 FF standoff**.  The head of the screw should touch the underside of the **battery plate**, and the **4-40 FF standoff** should touch the top side of the **battery ring**.  For now, you can simply tighten the standoff by hand.  Repeat this process for all six holes.

Next, tighten the screws using a crisscross pattern with multiple stages.  Hold each standoff in place with a *3/16 hex screwdriver* and tighten the screw with a *small Philips screwdriver*.

3.2 Attach Battery Cradle
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Screw tightness: *tight*

Align the battery cradle created in step 3.1 with the six holes shown on the **base plate**.  The standoffs should touch the underside of the **base plate**.  Hold each standoff in place with a **4-40 7/16 screw (D)** (6 total).  Use a *small Philips screwdriver* to tighten the screws in a crisscross pattern with multiple stages.
