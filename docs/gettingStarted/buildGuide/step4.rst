Step 4: PWM
============================================

New parts used in this step (see the :ref:`parts_list` for details):

* **PWM**
* Two **2-56 MF standoffs**
* Two **2-56 screws (F)**

4.1 Attach Standoffs
""""""""""""""""""""

Screw tightness: *very gentle*

Use a *3/16 hex screwdriver* to screw two **2-56 MF standoffs** into the two holes shown on uncolored side of the **bottom plate**.  These holes are toward the front of the car but behind the camera.

4.2 Attach PWM
""""""""""""""

| **Warning**: *discharge any static before touching the Jetson Nano*\
| Screw tightness: *gentle*

Carefully align the two screw holes of the **PWM** with the **2-56 MF standoffs** attached in step 4.1.  Make sure that the mini USB port of the **PWM** points upward as shown in the pictures below.  Secure the the **PWM** to the standoffs with **2-56 1/4 screws (F)** using a *small Philips screwdriver*.  Remember to tighten the screws in multiple stages.
