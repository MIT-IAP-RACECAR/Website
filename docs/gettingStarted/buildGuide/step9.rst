* A variety of USB cables
* Wi-Fi Adaptor (dongle)
* Keyboard Adaptor (dongle)
* Zip ties
* Springs

9.1 Wire USB Connections
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The images below illustrate how devices are to be wired together. Use zip ties as necessary to secure wires along the way.

9.2 Replace Springs
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The springs in the car's suspension must be replaced to accomodate the additional weight of the electronics to be installed. 

If you haven't already done so, remove the cotter pins holding the car's shell to the chassis and remove the shell.

Use a *hex screwdriver* to remove the struts and original coil springs one at a time. Keep track of where each strut is removed so it may be reattached in the same location.

The original springs are black in color and smaller gauge wire (below, left) than the replacment springs (below, right).
