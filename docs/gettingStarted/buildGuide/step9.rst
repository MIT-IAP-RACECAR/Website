Step 9: Lidar
============================================

Screw tightness: *gentle*

New parts used in this step (see the :ref:`parts_list` for details):

* **Lidar**
* Four **M2.5x0.45 12mm screws (H)**

Align the four legs of the **Lidar** with the with the holes shown on the blue side of the **top plate**, which are toward the front of the car.  Screw a **M2.5x0.45 12mm screw** into each leg (4 total) such that the head of each screw touches the uncolored side of the **top plate**.  Be sure to tighten the screws in multiple stages using a crisscross pattern.
