Phase 1 Challenge: Cone Slalom
============================================

At this point, we have explored several strategies for observing and responding to the environment around the car.  We now have all of the tools necessary to conquer our first major challenge!

Slalom is an olympic skiing event in which competitors weave around colored poles.  To emulate this event, we will program our car to weave around colored cones.

  A skier racing on a slalom course.

The course will consist of a line of cones one meter apart alternating between red and blue, with the first cone red.  The car should weave between the cones such that it passes each red cone on its left and each blue cone on its right.  Your goal is to complete the course as quickly as possible without hitting any cones.
